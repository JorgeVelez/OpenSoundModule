       <div>Along with the OSC server, the device also integrates a small web server. You can connect to it by entering the moduleâ€™s IP address in a web browser on any device connected to the same network.</div>
       <div>When in AP mode (green LED), enter this web address: <a href="http://192.168.0.1/">http://192.168.0.1/</a></div>
       <div>In the web interface you can configure the network settings, address mappings and more.</div>
